Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Hernandez, Farmer and Knight, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 8253 Elizabeth Fork Apt. 803
Blackport, SD 51671. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

New Haley, MO 41876",Odom Group,503-24-4835,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Odom Group for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Odom Group was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 6380 Johnson Pike
New Haley, MO 41876 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 503-24-4835 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Odom Group’s manufacturing unit at 6380 Johnson Pike
New Haley, MO 41876 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://www.hart.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 503-24-4835 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 503-24-4835, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Mike Wilson was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 6380 Johnson Pike
New Haley, MO 41876 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Odom Group should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Mike Wilson at marycook@example.org or +105 5176321729. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 6380 Johnson Pike

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Whitney PLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 5870 Johnson Prairie
South Markmouth, CO 05788. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2339, 2385, 'address'), (18, 29, 'company'), (1769, 1780, 'company')]"

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Markstad, MD 89509","Young, Cohen and Farmer",835-83-4788,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Young, Cohen and Farmer for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Young, Cohen and Farmer was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 8304 Williams Meadow
Markstad, MD 89509 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 835-83-4788 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Young, Cohen and Farmer’s manufacturing unit at 8304 Williams Meadow
Markstad, MD 89509 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://www.warner-peterson.net/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 835-83-4788 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 835-83-4788, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Monica Waters was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 8304 Williams Meadow
Markstad, MD 89509 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Young, Cohen and Farmer should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Monica Waters at qwashington@example.org or +21 2226940099. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 8304 Williams Meadow

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Vaughan-Carter, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 34977 Roberts Walk Suite 174
South Lauraland, DC 23895. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2346, 2400, 'address'), (18, 32, 'company'), (1773, 1787, 'company')]"

North Scotthaven, PR 06645",Stewart-Collins,790-60-7879,"Following the annual compliance schedule, a thorough evaluation of the internal controls within Stewart-Collins was conducted. This document outlines the methodologies adopted, key findings, and recommendations for strengthening internal processes and ensuring regulatory compliance. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of the existing controls and identify potential areas for enhancement.
The review process included both quantitative and qualitative assessments, leveraging advanced data analytics tools and direct observation techniques. The methodology encompassed:
Risk Assessment:
Identification and prioritization of risk areas within the financial and operational domains
Deployment of risk management frameworks to evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks
Control Testing:
Execution of control tests to verify the functionality and effectiveness of control measures
Analysis of control gaps and deficiencies in critical areas
Stakeholder Interviews:
Conducting interviews with key personnel to gather insights on control environments and operational challenges
Evaluation of the awareness and understanding of control policies among staff
Several critical findings emerged from the review, indicating areas that require immediate attention and corrective actions:
Financial Control Deficiencies:
Inconsistent application of accounting policies leading to discrepancies in financial reporting
Lack of adequate documentation for significant financial transactions
Operational Control Gaps:
Inefficiencies in the procurement process resulting in unauthorized purchases
Insufficient monitoring of inventory levels causing stock variances
Compliance Shortcomings:
Non-compliance with internal audit recommendations from previous assessments
Delays in regulatory filings and updates
To address the identified deficiencies and enhance the control environment, the following actions are recommended:
Financial Controls:
Standardization of accounting procedures across all departments
Complementation of a centralized documentation system for financial transactions
Operational Controls:
Revision of the procurement policy to include stricter approval processes
Regular inventory audits to ensure accuracy and accountability
Compliance Enhancements:
Establishment of a compliance oversight committee to monitor adherence to audit recommendations
Timely updating and submission of regulatory documents
The review highlights the necessity for continuous improvement in internal controls to mitigate risks and ensure compliance. The implementation of the recommended actions will significantly enhance the operational efficiency and financial integrity of Stewart-Collins
Attached to this document are detailed reports and evidence supporting the findings and recommendations. The Internal Compliance Unit is available for further discussions and clarifications

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

The management and Board of Directors of Fuller-Crane are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Laurafort, FM 90777",English-Hinton,817-02-9414,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by English-Hinton for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for English-Hinton was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 76517 Tony Forges
Laurafort, FM 90777 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 817-02-9414 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for English-Hinton’s manufacturing unit at 76517 Tony Forges
Laurafort, FM 90777 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://hunt.biz/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 817-02-9414 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 817-02-9414, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Tony Middleton was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 76517 Tony Forges
Laurafort, FM 90777 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at English-Hinton should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Tony Middleton at kwatson@example.org or +91 3637221569. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 76517 Tony Forges

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Byrd, Villanueva and Thomas, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 057 Powers Islands
Jessicaborough, IA 58694. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements.

Taylorborough, MH 06577","Le, Garza and Kelly",617-70-8055,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Le, Garza and Kelly for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Le, Garza and Kelly was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 47410 Lindsay Lock
Taylorborough, MH 06577 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 617-70-8055 end with ‘4567’ This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Le, Garza and Kelly’s manufacturing unit at 47410 Lindsay Lock
Taylorborough, MH 06577 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% pa

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://lecom/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 617-70-8055 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act Employee details, including SSNs 617-70-8055, were cross-checked with the HR records A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000 One such transaction involving a payment to Kendra Morales was identified where TDS was not deducted The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 47410 Lindsay Lock
Taylorborough, MH 06577 lacked proper documentation The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations The finance team at Le, Garza and Kelly should review this report and initiate the necessary actions For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Kendra Morales at dhill@examplecom or +91 4665168677 All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 47410 Lindsay Lock

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Roy PLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 95043 Oconnor Track
New Monica, NH 74687. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2332, 2372, 'address'), (18, 25, 'company'), (1766, 1773, 'company')]"

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements.

West Kellyfort, HI 06215",Briggs Ltd,616-67-7979,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Briggs Ltd for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Briggs Ltd was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 43602 Tonya Stravenue
West Kellyfort, HI 06215 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 616-67-7979 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Briggs Ltd’s manufacturing unit at 43602 Tonya Stravenue
West Kellyfort, HI 06215 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://barker.biz/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 616-67-7979 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 616-67-7979, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Sara Garcia was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 43602 Tonya Stravenue
West Kellyfort, HI 06215 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Briggs Ltd should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Sara Garcia at susanparker@example.net or +517 0810644708. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 43602 Tonya Stravenue

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Chavez, Conrad and Sanchez, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 899 Davidson Avenue
South Stephanie, OH 60200. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2370, 2415, 'address'), (18, 44, 'company'), (1785, 1811, 'company')]"

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Cobbburgh, MD 36710",Long-Armstrong,448-98-9305,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Long-Armstrong for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Long-Armstrong was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 772 Gibbs Fort
Cobbburgh, MD 36710 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 448-98-9305 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Long-Armstrong’s manufacturing unit at 772 Gibbs Fort
Cobbburgh, MD 36710 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://campos.info/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 448-98-9305 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 448-98-9305, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Andre Smith was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 772 Gibbs Fort
Cobbburgh, MD 36710 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Long-Armstrong should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Bennett-Rodriguez, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 3599 Johnny Locks Apt. 511
East Amy, SC 77215. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

Marcuston, UT 57577",Walker-Freeman,387-11-8978,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Walker-Freeman for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Walker-Freeman was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 69975 Whitaker Rapids
Marcuston, UT 57577 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 387-11-8978 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Walker-Freeman’s manufacturing unit at 69975 Whitaker Rapids
Marcuston, UT 57577 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://blankenship.info/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 387-11-8978 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 387-11-8978, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Nicole Harper was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 69975 Whitaker Rapids
Marcuston, UT 57577 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Walker-Freeman should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Nicole Harper at april59@example.org or +395 8698188273. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 69975 Whitaker Rapids

This review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Walker-Freeman remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Morse-Boyd, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 4560 Gregory Forks
Shepherdmouth, MN 13398 In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Tiffanyside, LA 36193","Garcia, Vargas and Oconnor",261-39-7857,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Garcia, Vargas and Oconnor for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Garcia, Vargas and Oconnor was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 4042 Johnson Knoll
Tiffanyside, LA 36193 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 261-39-7857 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Garcia, Vargas and Oconnor’s manufacturing unit at 4042 Johnson Knoll
Tiffanyside, LA 36193 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://abbott.biz/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 261-39-7857 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 261-39-7857, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Aaron Stafford was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 4042 Johnson Knoll
Tiffanyside, LA 36193 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Garcia, Vargas and Oconnor should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Aaron Stafford at amberstanley@example.org or +91 3883704448. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 4042 Johnson Knoll

This review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Garcia, Vargas and Oconnor remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Watkins, Park and Mcfarland, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at Unit 0756 Box 6196
DPO AP 94980. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2370, 2401, 'address'), (18, 45, 'company'), (1784, 1811, 'company')]"

This document outlines the methodologies adopted, key findings, and recommendations for strengthening internal processes and ensuring regulatory compliance. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of the existing controls and identify potential areas for enhancement.
The review process included both quantitative and qualitative assessments, leveraging advanced data analytics tools and direct observation techniques. The methodology encompassed:
Risk Assessment:
Identification and prioritization of risk areas within the financial and operational domains
Deployment of risk management frameworks to evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks
Control Testing:
Execution of control tests to verify the functionality and effectiveness of control measures
Analysis of control gaps and deficiencies in critical areas
Stakeholder Interviews:
Conducting interviews with key personnel to gather insights on control environments and operational challenges
Evaluation of the awareness and understanding of control policies among staff
Several critical findings emerged from the review, indicating areas that require immediate attention and corrective actions:
Financial Control Deficiencies:
Inconsistent application of accounting policies leading to discrepancies in financial reporting
Lack of adequate documentation for significant financial transactions
Operational Control Gaps:
Inefficiencies in the procurement process resulting in unauthorized purchases
Insufficient monitoring of inventory levels causing stock variances
Compliance Shortcomings:
Non-compliance with internal audit recommendations from previous assessments
Delays in regulatory filings and updates
To address the identified deficiencies and enhance the control environment, the following actions are recommended:
Financial Controls:
Standardization of accounting procedures across all departments
Complementation of a centralized documentation system for financial transactions
Operational Controls:
Revision of the procurement policy to include stricter approval processes
Regular inventory audits to ensure accuracy and accountability
Compliance Enhancements:
Establishment of a compliance oversight committee to monitor adherence to audit recommendations
Timely updating and submission of regulatory documents
The review highlights the necessity for continuous improvement in internal controls to mitigate risks and ensure compliance. The implementation of the recommended actions will significantly enhance the operational efficiency and financial integrity of Bennett-Smith
Attached to this document are detailed reports and evidence supporting the findings and recommendations. The Internal Compliance Unit is available for further discussions and clarifications

East Robertfurt, PR 93001",Turner Inc,544-82-8590,"Independent Auditor's Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of Turner Inc for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Turner Inc are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. For any queries, please contact Natalie Peterson at 919 Karen Avenue Apt. 103

New Kathryn, GA 36131",Thompson Inc,200-20-5917,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Thompson Inc for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Thompson Inc was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 77253 Smith Dale Apt. 987
New Kathryn, GA 36131 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 200-20-5917 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Thompson Inc’s manufacturing unit at 77253 Smith Dale Apt. 987
New Kathryn, GA 36131 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://bennett.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 200-20-5917 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 200-20-5917, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Kimberly Mclaughlin was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 77253 Smith Dale Apt. 987
New Kathryn, GA 36131 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Thompson Inc should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Elliott Ltd, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 590 Freeman Plains
Sabrinaburgh, MS 96623 In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

North Kristin, PW 74725",Morris Group,886-66-8220,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Morris Group for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Morris Group was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 2865 Franklin River Suite 648
North Kristin, PW 74725 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 886-66-8220 end with ‘4567’ This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Morris Group’s manufacturing unit at 2865 Franklin River Suite 648
North Kristin, PW 74725 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% pa

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://doyle-larsoninfo/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 886-66-8220 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act Employee details, including SSNs 886-66-8220, were cross-checked with the HR records A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000 One such transaction involving a payment to Karen Turner was identified where TDS was not deducted The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 2865 Franklin River Suite 648
North Kristin, PW 74725 lacked proper documentation The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Morris Group should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Karen Turner at melissamorales@example.net or +37 9263442179.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Wise, Yates and Merritt, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 044 Gilmore Manors Suite 605
South Ryan, WY 19146. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2364, 2413, 'address'), (18, 41, 'company'), (1782, 1805, 'company')]"

Port Danielhaven, VA 33267","Gallagher, Peterson and Anderson",234-01-2216,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Gallagher, Peterson and Anderson for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Gallagher, Peterson and Anderson was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 7972 Aaron Turnpike
Port Danielhaven, VA 33267 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 234-01-2216 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Gallagher, Peterson and Anderson’s manufacturing unit at 7972 Aaron Turnpike
Port Danielhaven, VA 33267 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://www.taylor.net/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 234-01-2216 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 234-01-2216, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Tracey Caldwell was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 7972 Aaron Turnpike
Port Danielhaven, VA 33267 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Gallagher, Peterson and Anderson should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Tracey Caldwell at xramirez@example.com or +78 3288920652. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 7972 Aaron Turnpike

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Fuller LLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 077 Maurice Harbors Apt. 884
Scottmouth, OH 60036. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2332, 2381, 'address'), (18, 28, 'company'), (1763, 1773, 'company')]"

DPO AE 14037",Schroeder LLC,392-13-6079,"Independent Auditor's Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of Schroeder LLC for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Schroeder LLC are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. For any queries, please contact Cynthia Romero at Unit 4183 Box 3848

East Shannon, MT 37622",Murphy-Harper,340-24-3516,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Murphy-Harper for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Murphy-Harper was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 06357 Lara Ways
East Shannon, MT 37622 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 340-24-3516 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Murphy-Harper’s manufacturing unit at 06357 Lara Ways
East Shannon, MT 37622 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://perez.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 340-24-3516 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 340-24-3516, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Dawn Johnson was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 06357 Lara Ways
East Shannon, MT 37622 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Murphy-Harper should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Dawn Johnson at kelly98@example.org or +051 8839778649. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 06357 Lara Ways

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Hood-Vasquez, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 400 Ernest Plains Apt. 217
West Michelleport, NH 58721. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements.

East Mark, DC 01617",Chavez-Gallegos,771-62-7470,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Chavez-Gallegos for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Chavez-Gallegos was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 8516 Branch Park
East Mark, DC 01617 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 771-62-7470 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Chavez-Gallegos’s manufacturing unit at 8516 Branch Park
East Mark, DC 01617 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://peterson.org/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 771-62-7470 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 771-62-7470, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Melissa Nichols was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 8516 Branch Park
East Mark, DC 01617 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Chavez-Gallegos should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Melissa Nichols at hancockmichael@example.com or +31 9807131525. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 8516 Branch Park

This review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Chavez-Gallegos remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Robbins-Sawyer, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 20684 Lee Trafficway Apt. 597
East Kevinland, UT 46883. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2346, 2400, 'address'), (18, 32, 'company'), (1773, 1787, 'company')]"

Johnsonmouth, NY 74688",Nguyen Ltd,223-71-2878,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Nguyen Ltd for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Nguyen Ltd was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 038 John Roads
Johnsonmouth, NY 74688 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 223-71-2878 end with ‘4567’ This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Nguyen Ltd’s manufacturing unit at 038 John Roads
Johnsonmouth, NY 74688 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://reese-jimenez.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 223-71-2878 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 223-71-2878, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Ronald Mueller was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 038 John Roads
Johnsonmouth, NY 74688 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Nguyen Ltd should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Ronald Mueller at william53@example.net or +036 5819529436. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 038 John Roads

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Nelson, Trujillo and Beasley, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 254 Ewing Valleys
Davisburgh, NV 00847. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2374, 2412, 'address'), (18, 46, 'company'), (1787, 1815, 'company')]"

In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Schultz, Scott and Castro are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. For any queries, please contact Donna Bruce at 540 Theresa Green Suite 242

Port Patrick, MH 46863",Johnson-Perez,186-64-8863,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Johnson-Perez for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Johnson-Perez was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 08855 Dustin Harbor Suite 148
Port Patrick, MH 46863 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 186-64-8863 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Johnson-Perez’s manufacturing unit at 08855 Dustin Harbor Suite 148
Port Patrick, MH 46863 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.pierce.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 186-64-8863 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 186-64-8863, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Kerry Bradshaw was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 08855 Dustin Harbor Suite 148
Port Patrick, MH 46863 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Johnson-Perez should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Garcia, Schmidt and Lucero, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 9693 Allen Plains
Lake Katherineborough, IL 87204.

Basis for opinion

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

Lake Tiffanymouth, VI 05040",Baker Inc,864-13-0736,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Baker Inc for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Baker Inc was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 637 Steven Fields Suite 542
Lake Tiffanymouth, VI 05040 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 864-13-0736 end with ‘4567’ This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Baker Inc’s manufacturing unit at 637 Steven Fields Suite 542
Lake Tiffanymouth, VI 05040 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% pa

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://davis-traninfo/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 864-13-0736 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 864-13-0736, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Alexander Anderson was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 637 Steven Fields Suite 542
Lake Tiffanymouth, VI 05040 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Baker Inc should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Alexander Anderson at john30@example.com or +91 5544349396.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Blair PLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 704 Tamara Square Suite 951
Cherylburgh, OR 61617. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2336, 2385, 'address'), (18, 27, 'company'), (1768, 1777, 'company')]"

Port Ronald, AK 06246",Collins-Hernandez,540-73-1801,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Collins-Hernandez for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Collins-Hernandez was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 4739 White Circles
Port Ronald, AK 06246 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 540-73-1801 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Collins-Hernandez’s manufacturing unit at 4739 White Circles
Port Ronald, AK 06246 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://vasquez.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 540-73-1801 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 540-73-1801, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Gabriel Wagner was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 4739 White Circles
Port Ronald, AK 06246 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Collins-Hernandez should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Gabriel Wagner at derekavila@example.com or +91 2507046338. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 4739 White Circles

This review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Collins-Hernandez remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Diaz PLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 77949 Jacqueline Passage Suite 260
Allenton, CT 73940. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2334, 2387, 'address'), (18, 26, 'company'), (1767, 1775, 'company')]"

Ashleyberg, AS 26991",Blackwell and Sons,402-51-0915,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Blackwell and Sons for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Blackwell and Sons was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 7173 Gallegos Shores Suite 489
Ashleyberg, AS 26991 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 402-51-0915 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Blackwell and Sons’s manufacturing unit at 7173 Gallegos Shores Suite 489
Ashleyberg, AS 26991 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.flowers.info/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 402-51-0915 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 402-51-0915, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Devin Harris was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 7173 Gallegos Shores Suite 489
Ashleyberg, AS 26991 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Blackwell and Sons should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Scott, Harrington and Mccann, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 44660 Victoria Station
Lisahaven, NH 14441. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2374, 2416, 'address'), (18, 46, 'company'), (1787, 1815, 'company')]"

Mayside, IA 66946",Kelley and Sons,132-22-7648,"Independent Auditor's Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of Kelley and Sons for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

New Lindashire, HI 24159","Mcguire, Lee and Martin",090-07-3729,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Mcguire, Lee and Martin for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Mcguire, Lee and Martin was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 231 Gabriel Tunnel
New Lindashire, HI 24159 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 090-07-3729 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Mcguire, Lee and Martin’s manufacturing unit at 231 Gabriel Tunnel
New Lindashire, HI 24159 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.bailey.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 090-07-3729 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 090-07-3729, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Richard Kelly was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 231 Gabriel Tunnel
New Lindashire, HI 24159 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Mcguire, Lee and Martin should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Richard Kelly at jacksoneric@example.org or +41 8452882309. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 231 Gabriel Tunnel

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Hall Ltd, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 1844 Katherine View
Port Marissafort, AS 82128. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2334, 2380, 'address'), (18, 26, 'company'), (1767, 1775, 'company')]"

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion.

Kingmouth, MS 18367","Gordon, Skinner and Terry",547-22-4550,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Gordon, Skinner and Terry for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Gordon, Skinner and Terry was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 687 Rodney Loop Apt. 970
Kingmouth, MS 18367 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 547-22-4550 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Gordon, Skinner and Terry’s manufacturing unit at 687 Rodney Loop Apt. 970
Kingmouth, MS 18367 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://francis.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 547-22-4550 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 547-22-4550, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Shawn Costa was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 687 Rodney Loop Apt. 970
Kingmouth, MS 18367 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Gordon, Skinner and Terry should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Shawn Costa at cainjacob@example.net or +91 0890747142. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 687 Rodney Loop Apt. 970

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Knox, Jones and Winters, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 2316 Nicole Extensions
North Benjaminland, AR 68028 In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2358, 2409, 'address'), (18, 41, 'company'), (1776, 1799, 'company')]"

This document outlines the methodologies adopted, key findings, and recommendations for strengthening internal processes and ensuring regulatory compliance. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of the existing controls and identify potential areas for enhancement.
The review process included both quantitative and qualitative assessments, leveraging advanced data analytics tools and direct observation techniques. The methodology encompassed:
Risk Assessment:
Identification and prioritization of risk areas within the financial and operational domains
Deployment of risk management frameworks to evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks
Control Testing:
Execution of control tests to verify the functionality and effectiveness of control measures
Analysis of control gaps and deficiencies in critical areas
Stakeholder Interviews:
Conducting interviews with key personnel to gather insights on control environments and operational challenges
Evaluation of the awareness and understanding of control policies among staff
Several critical findings emerged from the review, indicating areas that require immediate attention and corrective actions:
Financial Control Deficiencies:
Inconsistent application of accounting policies leading to discrepancies in financial reporting
Lack of adequate documentation for significant financial transactions
Operational Control Gaps:
Inefficiencies in the procurement process resulting in unauthorized purchases
Insufficient monitoring of inventory levels causing stock variances
Compliance Shortcomings:
Non-compliance with internal audit recommendations from previous assessments
Delays in regulatory filings and updates
To address the identified deficiencies and enhance the control environment, the following actions are recommended:
Financial Controls:
Standardization of accounting procedures across all departments
Complementation of a centralized documentation system for financial transactions
Operational Controls:
Revision of the procurement policy to include stricter approval processes
Regular inventory audits to ensure accuracy and accountability
Compliance Enhancements:
Establishment of a compliance oversight committee to monitor adherence to audit recommendations
Timely updating and submission of regulatory documents
The review highlights the necessity for continuous improvement in internal controls to mitigate risks and ensure compliance. The implementation of the recommended actions will significantly enhance the operational efficiency and financial integrity of Cooper, Rivera and Smith
Attached to this document are detailed reports and evidence supporting the findings and recommendations. The Internal Compliance Unit is available for further discussions and clarifications

South Nicholasburgh, NJ 66550",Hernandez-White,732-10-0699,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Hernandez-White for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Hernandez-White was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 4518 Laura Springs Apt. 546
South Nicholasburgh, NJ 66550 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 732-10-0699 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Hernandez-White’s manufacturing unit at 4518 Laura Springs Apt. 546
South Nicholasburgh, NJ 66550 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://phillips.net/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 732-10-0699 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 732-10-0699, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Cody Davis was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 4518 Laura Springs Apt. 546
South Nicholasburgh, NJ 66550 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Hernandez-White should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Cody Davis at erikaosborne@example.com or +91 6471060552.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Perry PLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 5482 Brooks Via Apt 643
East Diana, AK 68016.

Basis for opinion

Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances.

West Marc, WA 35234",Hunt Group,177-87-2486,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Hunt Group for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Hunt Group was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 5756 Tristan Views Apt 784
West Marc, WA 35234 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 177-87-2486 end with ‘4567’ This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Hunt Group’s manufacturing unit at 5756 Tristan Views Apt 784
West Marc, WA 35234 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% pa

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://nelsoninfo/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 177-87-2486 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act Employee details, including SSNs 177-87-2486, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Deborah Warren was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 5756 Tristan Views Apt. 784
West Marc, WA 35234 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Hunt Group should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Deborah Warren at lnewman@example.net or +432 4109460930.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Cantrell, Miller and Alexander, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 45478 Kirby Spur Suite 946
South Betty, AL 69508. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2378, 2426, 'address'), (18, 48, 'company'), (1789, 1819, 'company')]"

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

South Patriciastad, AR 49509",Jones-Pace,238-71-7354,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Jones-Pace for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Jones-Pace was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 3881 Sonya Coves
South Patriciastad, AR 49509 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 238-71-7354 end with ‘4567’ This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Jones-Pace’s manufacturing unit at 3881 Sonya Coves
South Patriciastad, AR 49509 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% pa

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://rodriguez.net/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 238-71-7354 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 238-71-7354, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Travis Savage was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 3881 Sonya Coves
South Patriciastad, AR 49509 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Jones-Pace should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Travis Savage at xchristensen@example.net or +47 6467317801. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 3881 Sonya Coves

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Rodgers, Gray and Harris, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 722 Barbara Cliff Apt. 183
New Autumnburgh, CA 60142. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2366, 2418, 'address'), (18, 42, 'company'), (1783, 1807, 'company')]"

This document outlines the methodologies adopted, key findings, and recommendations for strengthening internal processes and ensuring regulatory compliance. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of the existing controls and identify potential areas for enhancement.
The review process included both quantitative and qualitative assessments, leveraging advanced data analytics tools and direct observation techniques. The methodology encompassed:
Risk Assessment:
Identification and prioritization of risk areas within the financial and operational domains
Deployment of risk management frameworks to evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks
Control Testing:
Execution of control tests to verify the functionality and effectiveness of control measures
Analysis of control gaps and deficiencies in critical areas
Stakeholder Interviews:
Conducting interviews with key personnel to gather insights on control environments and operational challenges
Evaluation of the awareness and understanding of control policies among staff
Several critical findings emerged from the review, indicating areas that require immediate attention and corrective actions:
Financial Control Deficiencies:
Inconsistent application of accounting policies leading to discrepancies in financial reporting
Lack of adequate documentation for significant financial transactions
Operational Control Gaps:
Inefficiencies in the procurement process resulting in unauthorized purchases
Insufficient monitoring of inventory levels causing stock variances
Compliance Shortcomings:
Non-compliance with internal audit recommendations from previous assessments
Delays in regulatory filings and updates
To address the identified deficiencies and enhance the control environment, the following actions are recommended:
Financial Controls:
Standardization of accounting procedures across all departments
Complementation of a centralized documentation system for financial transactions
Operational Controls:
Revision of the procurement policy to include stricter approval processes
Regular inventory audits to ensure accuracy and accountability
Compliance Enhancements:
Establishment of a compliance oversight committee to monitor adherence to audit recommendations
Timely updating and submission of regulatory documents
The review highlights the necessity for continuous improvement in internal controls to mitigate risks and ensure compliance. The implementation of the recommended actions will significantly enhance the operational efficiency and financial integrity of Mueller PLC
Attached to this document are detailed reports and evidence supporting the findings and recommendations. The Internal Compliance Unit is available for further discussions and clarifications

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements.

Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Dean-Peterson are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. For any queries, please contact John Flores at 014 Kimberly Divide Suite 621

APO AE 89474","Lopez, Woodward and Adams",829-28-0815,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Lopez, Woodward and Adams for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Lopez, Woodward and Adams was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at PSC 6245, Box 3682
APO AE 89474 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 829-28-0815 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Lopez, Woodward and Adams’s manufacturing unit at PSC 6245, Box 3682
APO AE 89474 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://bridges-rosales.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 829-28-0815 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 829-28-0815, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Christopher Cook was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at PSC 6245, Box 3682
APO AE 89474 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Lopez, Woodward and Adams should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Christopher Cook at adamgrant@example.org or +91 0632012242. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at PSC 6245, Box 3682

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Garrett, Garner and Ford, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 08039 Cole Views
Danielmouth, MO 75409. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements.

APO AE 52957","Pitts, Hogan and Hunter",753-70-1915,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Pitts, Hogan and Hunter for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Pitts, Hogan and Hunter was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at PSC 5344, Box 9782
APO AE 52957 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 753-70-1915 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Pitts, Hogan and Hunter’s manufacturing unit at PSC 5344, Box 9782
APO AE 52957 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://murphy.biz/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 753-70-1915 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 753-70-1915, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Sarah Gallagher was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at PSC 5344, Box 9782
APO AE 52957 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Pitts, Hogan and Hunter should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes
Opinion

Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

Nortonside, OK 65023","Singh, Little and Harris",374-18-5458,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Singh, Little and Harris for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Singh, Little and Harris was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 266 Alan Island
Nortonside, OK 65023 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 374-18-5458 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Singh, Little and Harris’s manufacturing unit at 266 Alan Island
Nortonside, OK 65023 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.turner.net/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 374-18-5458 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 374-18-5458, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Luke Black MD was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 266 Alan Island
Nortonside, OK 65023 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Singh, Little and Harris should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Luke Black MD at prichards@example.com or +286 0904390330. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 266 Alan Island

This review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Singh, Little and Harris remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Robinson Group, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 64504 Timothy Gardens
North Rachel, MH 01451 In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2340, 2384, 'address'), (18, 32, 'company'), (1767, 1781, 'company')]"

Lake Bruce, FL 28910",Cochran-Ray,735-33-7337,"Following the annual compliance schedule, a thorough evaluation of the internal controls within Cochran-Ray was conducted. This document outlines the methodologies adopted, key findings, and recommendations for strengthening internal processes and ensuring regulatory compliance. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of the existing controls and identify potential areas for enhancement.
The review process included both quantitative and qualitative assessments, leveraging advanced data analytics tools and direct observation techniques. The methodology encompassed:
Risk Assessment:
Identification and prioritization of risk areas within the financial and operational domains
Deployment of risk management frameworks to evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks
Control Testing:
Execution of control tests to verify the functionality and effectiveness of control measures
Analysis of control gaps and deficiencies in critical areas
Stakeholder Interviews:
Conducting interviews with key personnel to gather insights on control environments and operational challenges
Evaluation of the awareness and understanding of control policies among staff
Several critical findings emerged from the review, indicating areas that require immediate attention and corrective actions:
Financial Control Deficiencies:
Inconsistent application of accounting policies leading to discrepancies in financial reporting
Lack of adequate documentation for significant financial transactions
Operational Control Gaps:
Inefficiencies in the procurement process resulting in unauthorized purchases
Insufficient monitoring of inventory levels causing stock variances
Compliance Shortcomings:
Non-compliance with internal audit recommendations from previous assessments
Delays in regulatory filings and updates
To address the identified deficiencies and enhance the control environment, the following actions are recommended:
Financial Controls:
Standardization of accounting procedures across all departments
Complementation of a centralized documentation system for financial transactions
Operational Controls:
Revision of the procurement policy to include stricter approval processes
Regular inventory audits to ensure accuracy and accountability
Compliance Enhancements:
Establishment of a compliance oversight committee to monitor adherence to audit recommendations
Timely updating and submission of regulatory documents
The review highlights the necessity for continuous improvement in internal controls to mitigate risks and ensure compliance. The implementation of the recommended actions will significantly enhance the operational efficiency and financial integrity of Cochran-Ray
Attached to this document are detailed reports and evidence supporting the findings and recommendations. The Internal Compliance Unit is available for further discussions and clarifications

East Patrick, MT 17410",Obrien Ltd,379-80-6872,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Obrien Ltd for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Obrien Ltd was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 8907 Lori Avenue Apt. 065
East Patrick, MT 17410 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 379-80-6872 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Obrien Ltd’s manufacturing unit at 8907 Lori Avenue Apt. 065
East Patrick, MT 17410 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://barrett.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 379-80-6872 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 379-80-6872, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Christopher Brennan was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 8907 Lori Avenue Apt. 065
East Patrick, MT 17410 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Obrien Ltd should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes

West Elizabethland, NC 61181",Waters-Bonilla,171-97-6368,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Waters-Bonilla for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Waters-Bonilla was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 66836 Carla Crossing
West Elizabethland, NC 61181 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 171-97-6368 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Waters-Bonilla’s manufacturing unit at 66836 Carla Crossing
West Elizabethland, NC 61181 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://www.wood-mckay.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 171-97-6368 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 171-97-6368, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Amber Hogan was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 66836 Carla Crossing
West Elizabethland, NC 61181 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Waters-Bonilla should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Amber Hogan at michael01@example.com or +832 6953372851. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 66836 Carla Crossing

This review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Waters-Bonilla remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Turner Inc, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 0414 Jody Mission
New Brandystad, ID 17504. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2338, 2380, 'address'), (18, 28, 'company'), (1769, 1779, 'company')]"

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

DPO AE 52380","Miller, Williams and Foley",074-77-3991,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Miller, Williams and Foley for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Miller, Williams and Foley was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at Unit 0374 Box 9290
DPO AE 52380 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 074-77-3991 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Miller, Williams and Foley’s manufacturing unit at Unit 0374 Box 9290
DPO AE 52380 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://juarez.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 074-77-3991 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 074-77-3991, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Ashley Powell was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at Unit 0374 Box 9290
DPO AE 52380 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Miller, Williams and Foley should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Ashley Powell at danielsrebekah@example.com or +36 7634123820. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at Unit 0374 Box 9290

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of West-Smith, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 5951 Knight Harbors Suite 373
South Elizabeth, MS 99594. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2338, 2393, 'address'), (18, 28, 'company'), (1769, 1779, 'company')]"

The review process included both quantitative and qualitative assessments, leveraging advanced data analytics tools and direct observation techniques. The methodology encompassed:
Risk Assessment:
Identification and prioritization of risk areas within the financial and operational domains
Deployment of risk management frameworks to evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks
Control Testing:
Execution of control tests to verify the functionality and effectiveness of control measures
Analysis of control gaps and deficiencies in critical areas
Stakeholder Interviews:
Conducting interviews with key personnel to gather insights on control environments and operational challenges
Evaluation of the awareness and understanding of control policies among staff
Several critical findings emerged from the review, indicating areas that require immediate attention and corrective actions:
Financial Control Deficiencies:
Inconsistent application of accounting policies leading to discrepancies in financial reporting
Lack of adequate documentation for significant financial transactions
Operational Control Gaps:
Inefficiencies in the procurement process resulting in unauthorized purchases
Insufficient monitoring of inventory levels causing stock variances
Compliance Shortcomings:
Non-compliance with internal audit recommendations from previous assessments
Delays in regulatory filings and updates
To address the identified deficiencies and enhance the control environment, the following actions are recommended:
Financial Controls:
Standardization of accounting procedures across all departments
Complementation of a centralized documentation system for financial transactions
Operational Controls:
Revision of the procurement policy to include stricter approval processes
Regular inventory audits to ensure accuracy and accountability
Compliance Enhancements:
Establishment of a compliance oversight committee to monitor adherence to audit recommendations
Timely updating and submission of regulatory documents
The review highlights the necessity for continuous improvement in internal controls to mitigate risks and ensure compliance. The implementation of the recommended actions will significantly enhance the operational efficiency and financial integrity of Tucker, Washington and Carr
Attached to this document are detailed reports and evidence supporting the findings and recommendations. The Internal Compliance Unit is available for further discussions and clarifications

Lake Lorraineland, MN 37983",Schmidt-Adams,867-04-0361,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Schmidt-Adams for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Schmidt-Adams was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 170 Robert Islands Apt 103
Lake Lorraineland, MN 37983 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 867-04-0361 end with ‘4567’ This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Schmidt-Adams’s manufacturing unit at 170 Robert Islands Apt 103
Lake Lorraineland, MN 37983 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% pa

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://hendersoncom/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 867-04-0361 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act Employee details, including SSNs 867-04-0361, were cross-checked with the HR records A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000 One such transaction involving a payment to Catherine Price was identified where TDS was not deducted The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 170 Robert Islands Apt. 103
Lake Lorraineland, MN 37983 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Schmidt-Adams should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Snyder LLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 2037 Stewart Brook
West Patrick, PR 42332. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2338, 2379, 'address'), (18, 28, 'company'), (1769, 1779, 'company')]"

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

Port Codyhaven, LA 87494",Burns-Contreras,632-90-1688,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Burns-Contreras for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Burns-Contreras was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 88387 Carla Drives Apt. 397
Port Codyhaven, LA 87494 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 632-90-1688 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Burns-Contreras’s manufacturing unit at 88387 Carla Drives Apt. 397
Port Codyhaven, LA 87494 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://hawkins.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 632-90-1688 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 632-90-1688, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Joe Bradford was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 88387 Carla Drives Apt. 397
Port Codyhaven, LA 87494 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Burns-Contreras should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Joe Bradford at sophia19@example.com or +815 0868263987.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Nichols LLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 87401 Charles Plains
Benjaminbury, ND 45253. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2340, 2383, 'address'), (18, 29, 'company'), (1770, 1781, 'company')]"

South John, MO 46560",Allen Group,762-85-8511,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Allen Group for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Allen Group was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 2335 Hernandez Orchard
South John, MO 46560 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 762-85-8511 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Allen Group’s manufacturing unit at 2335 Hernandez Orchard
South John, MO 46560 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.scott.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 762-85-8511 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 762-85-8511, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Cindy Davis was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 2335 Hernandez Orchard
South John, MO 46560 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Allen Group should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Cindy Davis at bonniereynolds@example.org or +192 5976787369.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Anderson, Garcia and Howell, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 91874 Samantha Cliff
West Justinton, KS 25184. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2366, 2411, 'address'), (18, 45, 'company'), (1780, 1807, 'company')]"

Loganmouth, MA 46082",Martin-Oliver,611-50-4035,"Following the annual compliance schedule, a thorough evaluation of the internal controls within Martin-Oliver was conducted. This document outlines the methodologies adopted, key findings, and recommendations for strengthening internal processes and ensuring regulatory compliance. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of the existing controls and identify potential areas for enhancement.
The review process included both quantitative and qualitative assessments, leveraging advanced data analytics tools and direct observation techniques. The methodology encompassed:
Risk Assessment:
Identification and prioritization of risk areas within the financial and operational domains
Deployment of risk management frameworks to evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks
Control Testing:
Execution of control tests to verify the functionality and effectiveness of control measures
Analysis of control gaps and deficiencies in critical areas
Stakeholder Interviews:
Conducting interviews with key personnel to gather insights on control environments and operational challenges
Evaluation of the awareness and understanding of control policies among staff
Several critical findings emerged from the review, indicating areas that require immediate attention and corrective actions:
Financial Control Deficiencies:
Inconsistent application of accounting policies leading to discrepancies in financial reporting
Lack of adequate documentation for significant financial transactions
Operational Control Gaps:
Inefficiencies in the procurement process resulting in unauthorized purchases
Insufficient monitoring of inventory levels causing stock variances
Compliance Shortcomings:
Non-compliance with internal audit recommendations from previous assessments
Delays in regulatory filings and updates
To address the identified deficiencies and enhance the control environment, the following actions are recommended:
Financial Controls:
Standardization of accounting procedures across all departments
Complementation of a centralized documentation system for financial transactions
Operational Controls:
Revision of the procurement policy to include stricter approval processes
Regular inventory audits to ensure accuracy and accountability
Compliance Enhancements:
Establishment of a compliance oversight committee to monitor adherence to audit recommendations
Timely updating and submission of regulatory documents

Chambershaven, TX 62071",Bell-Garcia,807-92-5802,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Bell-Garcia for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Bell-Garcia was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 238 Kayla Villages Apt. 348
Chambershaven, TX 62071 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 807-92-5802 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Bell-Garcia’s manufacturing unit at 238 Kayla Villages Apt. 348
Chambershaven, TX 62071 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.lopez-moreno.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 807-92-5802 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 807-92-5802, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Robin Guzman was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 238 Kayla Villages Apt. 348
Chambershaven, TX 62071 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Bell-Garcia should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Robin Guzman at kathleenmercer@example.com or +505 3819351255.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Simpson Group, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 0616 Jeanette Circles
Jessicafurt, OK 16273. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2344, 2387, 'address'), (18, 31, 'company'), (1772, 1785, 'company')]"

Heatherland, DC 05399",White-Miller,013-02-5444,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by White-Miller for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for White-Miller was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 1737 Hogan Tunnel
Heatherland, DC 05399 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 013-02-5444 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for White-Miller’s manufacturing unit at 1737 Hogan Tunnel
Heatherland, DC 05399 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://www.carson.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 013-02-5444 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 013-02-5444, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Michael King was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 1737 Hogan Tunnel
Heatherland, DC 05399 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at White-Miller should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Michael King at kelsey80@example.org or +514 3340198885. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 1737 Hogan Tunnel

This review reflects our commitment to ensuring that White-Miller remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Mckenzie Inc, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at USCGC Woodward
FPO AE 63242. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

West Joshua, WV 95192",Williams Group,076-98-3548,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Williams Group for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Williams Group was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 752 Malik Wells
West Joshua, WV 95192 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 076-98-3548 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Williams Group’s manufacturing unit at 752 Malik Wells
West Joshua, WV 95192 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.sanchez.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 076-98-3548 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 076-98-3548, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Ashley Maynard was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 752 Malik Wells
West Joshua, WV 95192 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Rodgers PLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 2171 Robinson Orchard Suite 362
Daniellehaven, NY 52105. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2340, 2395, 'address'), (18, 29, 'company'), (1770, 1781, 'company')]"

DPO AP 28049",Silva Inc,164-65-8411,"Following the annual compliance schedule, a thorough evaluation of the internal controls within Silva Inc was conducted. This document outlines the methodologies adopted, key findings, and recommendations for strengthening internal processes and ensuring regulatory compliance. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of the existing controls and identify potential areas for enhancement.
The review process included both quantitative and qualitative assessments, leveraging advanced data analytics tools and direct observation techniques. The methodology encompassed:
Risk Assessment:
Identification and prioritization of risk areas within the financial and operational domains
Deployment of risk management frameworks to evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks
Control Testing:
Execution of control tests to verify the functionality and effectiveness of control measures
Analysis of control gaps and deficiencies in critical areas
Stakeholder Interviews:
Conducting interviews with key personnel to gather insights on control environments and operational challenges
Evaluation of the awareness and understanding of control policies among staff
Several critical findings emerged from the review, indicating areas that require immediate attention and corrective actions:
Financial Control Deficiencies:
Inconsistent application of accounting policies leading to discrepancies in financial reporting
Lack of adequate documentation for significant financial transactions
Operational Control Gaps:
Inefficiencies in the procurement process resulting in unauthorized purchases
Insufficient monitoring of inventory levels causing stock variances
Compliance Shortcomings:
Non-compliance with internal audit recommendations from previous assessments
Delays in regulatory filings and updates
To address the identified deficiencies and enhance the control environment, the following actions are recommended:
Financial Controls:
Standardization of accounting procedures across all departments
Complementation of a centralized documentation system for financial transactions
Operational Controls:
Revision of the procurement policy to include stricter approval processes
Regular inventory audits to ensure accuracy and accountability
Compliance Enhancements:
Establishment of a compliance oversight committee to monitor adherence to audit recommendations
Timely updating and submission of regulatory documents
The review highlights the necessity for continuous improvement in internal controls to mitigate risks and ensure compliance. The implementation of the recommended actions will significantly enhance the operational efficiency and financial integrity of Silva Inc

Nobletown, LA 69981",Moyer-Crosby,531-10-3127,"Independent Auditor's Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of Moyer-Crosby for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Moyer-Crosby are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. For any queries, please contact Elizabeth Proctor at 695 Parker Trail

West Evanburgh, OR 22480",Snow-Kelley,318-90-4075,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Snow-Kelley for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Snow-Kelley was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 3015 Deborah Knoll
West Evanburgh, OR 22480 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 318-90-4075 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Snow-Kelley’s manufacturing unit at 3015 Deborah Knoll
West Evanburgh, OR 22480 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.parrish.info/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 318-90-4075 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 318-90-4075, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Ronnie Smith was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 3015 Deborah Knoll
West Evanburgh, OR 22480 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Snow-Kelley should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Ronnie Smith at willieaustin@example.org or +91 0642158296. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 3015 Deborah Knoll

Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

DPO AA 75476",Bruce LLC,390-47-0443,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Bruce LLC for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Bruce LLC was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at Unit 3104 Box 6161
DPO AA 75476 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 390-47-0443 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Bruce LLC’s manufacturing unit at Unit 3104 Box 6161
DPO AA 75476 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://www.brock.info/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 390-47-0443 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 390-47-0443, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Kimberly Mccoy was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at Unit 3104 Box 6161
DPO AA 75476 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Bruce LLC should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Kimberly Mccoy at snyderrodney@example.net or +33 3614301676. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at Unit 3104 Box 6161

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Sanders PLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 5957 Heather Dale Apt. 416
Williamfort, IA 73578. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2340, 2388, 'address'), (18, 29, 'company'), (1770, 1781, 'company')]"

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

Lake Ralphborough, NH 41634",Snyder-Watkins,080-70-1953,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Snyder-Watkins for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Snyder-Watkins was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 574 Michael Mountains
Lake Ralphborough, NH 41634 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 080-70-1953 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Snyder-Watkins’s manufacturing unit at 574 Michael Mountains
Lake Ralphborough, NH 41634 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://whitaker.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 080-70-1953 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 080-70-1953, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Taylor Wise was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 574 Michael Mountains
Lake Ralphborough, NH 41634 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Ward Ltd, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 77139 Lopez Street Apt. 238
Cooperview, RI 83701. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2334, 2382, 'address'), (18, 26, 'company'), (1767, 1775, 'company')]"

Inconsistent application of accounting policies leading to discrepancies in financial reporting
Lack of adequate documentation for significant financial transactions
Operational Control Gaps:
Inefficiencies in the procurement process resulting in unauthorized purchases
Insufficient monitoring of inventory levels causing stock variances

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Moss, Mosley and Reed are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. For any queries, please contact Daniel Werner at 2334 Jorge Centers

New Sean, NE 51799",Spencer-Reeves,307-82-7213,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Spencer-Reeves for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Spencer-Reeves was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 7480 Jane Branch Apt 177
New Sean, NE 51799 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 307-82-7213 end with ‘4567’ This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Spencer-Reeves’s manufacturing unit at 7480 Jane Branch Apt 177
New Sean, NE 51799 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% pa

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://wwwsimmons-taylorcom/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 307-82-7213 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act Employee details, including SSNs 307-82-7213, were cross-checked with the HR records A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000 One such transaction involving a payment to Denise Allen was identified where TDS was not deducted The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 7480 Jane Branch Apt 177
New Sean, NE 51799 lacked proper documentation The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations The finance team at Spencer-Reeves should review this report and initiate the necessary actions For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Denise Allen at hartbarbara@exampleorg or +15 4585164457 All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 7480 Jane Branch Apt 177

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Sanchez-Flores, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 3994 Joshua Villages
Greermouth, KY 46633. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2346, 2387, 'address'), (18, 32, 'company'), (1773, 1787, 'company')]"

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

North Taylor, WA 67435","Lopez, Erickson and Garza",229-99-8713,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Lopez, Erickson and Garza for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Lopez, Erickson and Garza was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 2525 Wong Turnpike
North Taylor, WA 67435 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 229-99-8713 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Lopez, Erickson and Garza’s manufacturing unit at 2525 Wong Turnpike
North Taylor, WA 67435 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://www.woodard-cole.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 229-99-8713 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 229-99-8713, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Thomas Atkins was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 2525 Wong Turnpike
North Taylor, WA 67435 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Lopez, Erickson and Garza should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Thomas Atkins at sarahmaldonado@example.net or +18 0711501038. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 2525 Wong Turnpike

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes

New Donaldburgh, PR 42181 In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

Lisaton, MA 49198","Dorsey, Hernandez and Lloyd",641-42-3790,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Dorsey, Hernandez and Lloyd for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Dorsey, Hernandez and Lloyd was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 350 Pham Islands
Lisaton, MA 49198 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 641-42-3790 end with ‘4567’ This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Dorsey, Hernandez and Lloyd’s manufacturing unit at 350 Pham Islands
Lisaton, MA 49198 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% pa

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://wwwgallowaycom/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 641-42-3790 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act Employee details, including SSNs 641-42-3790, were cross-checked with the HR records A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000 One such transaction involving a payment to Trevor Baker was identified where TDS was not deducted The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 350 Pham Islands
Lisaton, MA 49198 lacked proper documentation The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Dorsey, Hernandez and Lloyd should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Bolton and Sons, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 4792 Johnson Flat Apt. 087
North Shannonmouth, ND 43215. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2348, 2403, 'address'), (18, 33, 'company'), (1774, 1789, 'company')]"

Several critical findings emerged from the review, indicating areas that require immediate attention and corrective actions:
Financial Control Deficiencies:
Inconsistent application of accounting policies leading to discrepancies in financial reporting
Lack of adequate documentation for significant financial transactions
Operational Control Gaps:
Inefficiencies in the procurement process resulting in unauthorized purchases

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Martin-Carter are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. For any queries, please contact Andrew Miller at 003 Savage Lodge Suite 665

Richardburgh, AS 80171",Castro-Smith,021-70-2807,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Castro-Smith for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Castro-Smith was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 21927 Jason Crossroad Suite 173
Richardburgh, AS 80171 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 021-70-2807 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Castro-Smith’s manufacturing unit at 21927 Jason Crossroad Suite 173
Richardburgh, AS 80171 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://jones-pham.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 021-70-2807 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 021-70-2807, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Jimmy Love was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 21927 Jason Crossroad Suite 173
Richardburgh, AS 80171 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Castro-Smith should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Jimmy Love at suarezstacy@example.org or +366 9184049686.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Hawkins-Perkins, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 3236 Kenneth Estates
North Josephstad, DC 79787. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2348, 2395, 'address'), (18, 33, 'company'), (1774, 1789, 'company')]"

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

Torreshaven, IN 85476",Williams-Gonzales,828-79-9568,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Williams-Gonzales for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Williams-Gonzales was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 7416 Marco Mountains
Torreshaven, IN 85476 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 828-79-9568 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Williams-Gonzales’s manufacturing unit at 7416 Marco Mountains
Torreshaven, IN 85476 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://parker.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 828-79-9568 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 828-79-9568, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Christopher Smith was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 7416 Marco Mountains
Torreshaven, IN 85476 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Williams-Gonzales should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Christopher Smith at bradley50@example.net or +39 9820214614. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 7416 Marco Mountains

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Love, Huffman and Watkins, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at PSC 3972, Box 8332
APO AE 20515. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2368, 2399, 'address'), (18, 43, 'company'), (1784, 1809, 'company')]"

Evaluation of the awareness and understanding of control policies among staff
Several critical findings emerged from the review, indicating areas that require immediate attention and corrective actions:
Financial Control Deficiencies:
Inconsistent application of accounting policies leading to discrepancies in financial reporting
Lack of adequate documentation for significant financial transactions
Operational Control Gaps:
Inefficiencies in the procurement process resulting in unauthorized purchases
Insufficient monitoring of inventory levels causing stock variances
Compliance Shortcomings:

West Aliciamouth, IL 01801","Frey, Mooney and Mcdonald",524-50-0015,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Frey, Mooney and Mcdonald for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Frey, Mooney and Mcdonald was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 5385 Pierce Lakes Suite 069
West Aliciamouth, IL 01801 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 524-50-0015 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Frey, Mooney and Mcdonald’s manufacturing unit at 5385 Pierce Lakes Suite 069
West Aliciamouth, IL 01801 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.thompson-jennings.org/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 524-50-0015 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 524-50-0015, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Teresa Pace was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 5385 Pierce Lakes Suite 069
West Aliciamouth, IL 01801 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Murphy Group, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 4699 Gonzalez Courts
South Vanessa, VI 36788. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2337, 2381, 'address'), (18, 30, 'company'), (1766, 1778, 'company')]"

East Cynthia, TN 61439",Cain-Lam,226-98-5602,"Following the annual compliance schedule, a thorough evaluation of the internal controls within Cain-Lam was conducted. This document outlines the methodologies adopted, key findings, and recommendations for strengthening internal processes and ensuring regulatory compliance. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of the existing controls and identify potential areas for enhancement.
The review process included both quantitative and qualitative assessments, leveraging advanced data analytics tools and direct observation techniques. The methodology encompassed:
Risk Assessment:
Identification and prioritization of risk areas within the financial and operational domains
Deployment of risk management frameworks to evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks
Control Testing:
Execution of control tests to verify the functionality and effectiveness of control measures
Analysis of control gaps and deficiencies in critical areas
Stakeholder Interviews:
Conducting interviews with key personnel to gather insights on control environments and operational challenges
Evaluation of the awareness and understanding of control policies among staff
Several critical findings emerged from the review, indicating areas that require immediate attention and corrective actions:
Financial Control Deficiencies:
Inconsistent application of accounting policies leading to discrepancies in financial reporting
Lack of adequate documentation for significant financial transactions
Operational Control Gaps:
Inefficiencies in the procurement process resulting in unauthorized purchases
Insufficient monitoring of inventory levels causing stock variances
Compliance Shortcomings:
Non-compliance with internal audit recommendations from previous assessments
Delays in regulatory filings and updates
To address the identified deficiencies and enhance the control environment, the following actions are recommended:
Financial Controls:
Standardization of accounting procedures across all departments
Complementation of a centralized documentation system for financial transactions
Operational Controls:
Revision of the procurement policy to include stricter approval processes
Regular inventory audits to ensure accuracy and accountability
Compliance Enhancements:
Establishment of a compliance oversight committee to monitor adherence to audit recommendations

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Oneill, Ramsey and Williams are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. For any queries, please contact Christopher Trevino at 84863 Sally Well Suite 019

Powersview, MH 30982",Huynh-Hamilton,677-26-4760,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Huynh-Hamilton for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Huynh-Hamilton was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 0483 Margaret Loop Suite 217
Powersview, MH 30982 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 677-26-4760 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Huynh-Hamilton’s manufacturing unit at 0483 Margaret Loop Suite 217
Powersview, MH 30982 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.wu.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 677-26-4760 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 677-26-4760, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Lee Figueroa was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 0483 Margaret Loop Suite 217
Powersview, MH 30982 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Huynh-Hamilton should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Lee Figueroa at warddaniel@example.com or +91 1167405948.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

FPO AP 25309",Gamble-Gilbert,307-17-2556,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Gamble-Gilbert for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Gamble-Gilbert was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at USNS Beasley
FPO AP 25309 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 307-17-2556 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Gamble-Gilbert’s manufacturing unit at USNS Beasley
FPO AP 25309 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://www.white.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 307-17-2556 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 307-17-2556, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Kristina Johnson was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at USNS Beasley
FPO AP 25309 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Gamble-Gilbert should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Kristina Johnson at delgadotanya@example.org or +62 0744797733. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at USNS Beasley

This review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Gamble-Gilbert remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Smith, Wells and Sawyer, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 2671 Todd Stravenue Suite 553
West Christopher, DC 51737. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2362, 2418, 'address'), (18, 41, 'company'), (1780, 1803, 'company')]"

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

DPO AP 83965",Brown PLC,211-23-1815,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Brown PLC for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Brown PLC was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at Unit 3539 Box 3767
DPO AP 83965 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 211-23-1815 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Brown PLC’s manufacturing unit at Unit 3539 Box 3767
DPO AP 83965 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://cooper.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 211-23-1815 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 211-23-1815, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Deborah Williams was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at Unit 3539 Box 3767
DPO AP 83965 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Finley-Reyes, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at USCGC Stephens
FPO AP 77553. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2342, 2369, 'address'), (18, 30, 'company'), (1771, 1783, 'company')]"

Medinahaven, FL 86140","Nelson, Cox and Pittman",264-32-4462,"Following the annual compliance schedule, a thorough evaluation of the internal controls within Nelson, Cox and Pittman was conducted. This document outlines the methodologies adopted, key findings, and recommendations for strengthening internal processes and ensuring regulatory compliance. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of the existing controls and identify potential areas for enhancement.
The review process included both quantitative and qualitative assessments, leveraging advanced data analytics tools and direct observation techniques. The methodology encompassed:
Risk Assessment:
Identification and prioritization of risk areas within the financial and operational domains
Deployment of risk management frameworks to evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks
Control Testing:
Execution of control tests to verify the functionality and effectiveness of control measures
Analysis of control gaps and deficiencies in critical areas
Stakeholder Interviews:
Conducting interviews with key personnel to gather insights on control environments and operational challenges
Evaluation of the awareness and understanding of control policies among staff
Several critical findings emerged from the review, indicating areas that require immediate attention and corrective actions:
Financial Control Deficiencies:
Inconsistent application of accounting policies leading to discrepancies in financial reporting
Lack of adequate documentation for significant financial transactions
Operational Control Gaps:
Inefficiencies in the procurement process resulting in unauthorized purchases
Insufficient monitoring of inventory levels causing stock variances
Compliance Shortcomings:

APO AP 44724",Green-Berger,193-50-6317,"Independent Auditor's Report on the Standalone Financial Statements of Green-Berger for the fiscal year ended March 31, 2023. The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Green-Berger are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so. The Board of Directors are also responsible for overseeing the Company’s financial reporting process. For any queries, please contact Christopher Clarke at PSC 6281, Box 4106

Lake Ashlee, HI 20881","Banks, Morris and Willis",155-27-9894,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Banks, Morris and Willis for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Banks, Morris and Willis was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 130 Scott Road
Lake Ashlee, HI 20881 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 155-27-9894 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Banks, Morris and Willis’s manufacturing unit at 130 Scott Road
Lake Ashlee, HI 20881 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://www.owens.info/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 155-27-9894 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 155-27-9894, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Sarah Smith was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 130 Scott Road
Lake Ashlee, HI 20881 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Banks, Morris and Willis should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Sarah Smith at vjames@example.com or +91 5023564722. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 130 Scott Road

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Meyer Ltd, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 556 Kevin Terrace
Danielsmouth, PW 48301. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2336, 2376, 'address'), (18, 27, 'company'), (1768, 1777, 'company')]"

Brandyton, DE 86361",Bailey LLC,413-76-5315,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Bailey LLC for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Bailey LLC was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 80276 Christopher Cliffs
Brandyton, DE 86361 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 413-76-5315 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Bailey LLC’s manufacturing unit at 80276 Christopher Cliffs
Brandyton, DE 86361 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://li.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 413-76-5315 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 413-76-5315, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Shannon Todd was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 80276 Christopher Cliffs
Brandyton, DE 86361 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Bailey LLC should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Shannon Todd at jmiller@example.org or +24 6314625119. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 80276 Christopher Cliffs

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Nelson Group, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 126 Morton Pike Apt. 560
North Kenneth, SC 61962. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2342, 2390, 'address'), (18, 30, 'company'), (1771, 1783, 'company')]"

East Amber, GU 36635","Clark, Fischer and Bates",647-34-1226,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Clark, Fischer and Bates for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Clark, Fischer and Bates was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 52839 Meyers Knoll Apt. 592
East Amber, GU 36635 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 647-34-1226 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Clark, Fischer and Bates’s manufacturing unit at 52839 Meyers Knoll Apt. 592
East Amber, GU 36635 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://jones.org/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 647-34-1226 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 647-34-1226, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Mary Morales was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 52839 Meyers Knoll Apt. 592
East Amber, GU 36635 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Clark, Fischer and Bates should review this report and initiate the necessary actions.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Bishop, Ferguson and Morris, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 5953 Griffin Station
Lake Adrian, TN 57101. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2372, 2414, 'address'), (18, 45, 'company'), (1786, 1813, 'company')]"

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended. Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. The management and Board of Directors of Hall, Hicks and Sullivan are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

New Alexisside, IN 59204",Anderson Inc,503-44-2930,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Anderson Inc for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Anderson Inc was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 45400 David Branch
New Alexisside, IN 59204 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 503-44-2930 end with ‘4567’ This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Anderson Inc’s manufacturing unit at 45400 David Branch
New Alexisside, IN 59204 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% pa

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://wwwmaddox-wongorg/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 503-44-2930 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act Employee details, including SSNs 503-44-2930, were cross-checked with the HR records A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000 One such transaction involving a payment to Tommy Rodriguez was identified where TDS was not deducted The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 45400 David Branch
New Alexisside, IN 59204 lacked proper documentation The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Anderson Inc should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Tommy Rodriguez at howelljonathan@example.com or +91 6518167460.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Gates Inc, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at Unit 6708 Box 2988
DPO AA 69609. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2336, 2367, 'address'), (18, 27, 'company'), (1768, 1777, 'company')]"

Port Michelleville, OR 92685",Moran-Hayes,683-04-3164,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Moran-Hayes for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023 Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Moran-Hayes was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 818 Luis Passage
Port Michelleville, OR 92685 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 683-04-3164 end with ‘4567’ This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Moran-Hayes’s manufacturing unit at 818 Luis Passage
Port Michelleville, OR 92685 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% pa

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://www.smith-gibbs.net/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 683-04-3164 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 683-04-3164, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Tiffany Burton was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 818 Luis Passage
Port Michelleville, OR 92685 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Moran-Hayes should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Tiffany Burton at theodore21@example.org or +91 9942828692. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 818 Luis Passage

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of James LLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 4545 Sosa Trail Suite 070
South Elizabethshire, FL 44573. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2336, 2392, 'address'), (18, 27, 'company'), (1768, 1777, 'company')]"

This document outlines the methodologies adopted, key findings, and recommendations for strengthening internal processes and ensuring regulatory compliance. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of the existing controls and identify potential areas for enhancement.
The review process included both quantitative and qualitative assessments, leveraging advanced data analytics tools and direct observation techniques. The methodology encompassed:
Risk Assessment:
Identification and prioritization of risk areas within the financial and operational domains
Deployment of risk management frameworks to evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks
Control Testing:
Execution of control tests to verify the functionality and effectiveness of control measures
Analysis of control gaps and deficiencies in critical areas
Stakeholder Interviews:
Conducting interviews with key personnel to gather insights on control environments and operational challenges
Evaluation of the awareness and understanding of control policies among staff
Several critical findings emerged from the review, indicating areas that require immediate attention and corrective actions:
Financial Control Deficiencies:
Inconsistent application of accounting policies leading to discrepancies in financial reporting
Lack of adequate documentation for significant financial transactions
Operational Control Gaps:
Inefficiencies in the procurement process resulting in unauthorized purchases
Insufficient monitoring of inventory levels causing stock variances
Compliance Shortcomings:
Non-compliance with internal audit recommendations from previous assessments
Delays in regulatory filings and updates
To address the identified deficiencies and enhance the control environment, the following actions are recommended:
Financial Controls:
Standardization of accounting procedures across all departments
Complementation of a centralized documentation system for financial transactions
Operational Controls:
Revision of the procurement policy to include stricter approval processes
Regular inventory audits to ensure accuracy and accountability
Compliance Enhancements:
Establishment of a compliance oversight committee to monitor adherence to audit recommendations
Timely updating and submission of regulatory documents
The review highlights the necessity for continuous improvement in internal controls to mitigate risks and ensure compliance. The implementation of the recommended actions will significantly enhance the operational efficiency and financial integrity of Ruiz Inc

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

Port Jameston, VT 56757",Sawyer LLC,353-85-7781,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Sawyer LLC for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Sawyer LLC was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 931 Matthews Road
Port Jameston, VT 56757 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 353-85-7781 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Sawyer LLC’s manufacturing unit at 931 Matthews Road
Port Jameston, VT 56757 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://mitchell.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 353-85-7781 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 353-85-7781, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Audrey Williams was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 931 Matthews Road
Port Jameston, VT 56757 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Sawyer LLC should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Audrey Williams at dflores@example.net or +909 7480358299. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 931 Matthews Road
Port Jameston, VT 56757.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Powell PLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 828 Tracy Mission Suite 674
Samanthaburgh, MS 50741. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics.

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

The management and Board of Directors of Tanner-Howell are responsible for the matters stated in section 134(5) of the Companies Act, 2013 with respect to the preparation of these standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view of the financial position, financial performance, and cash flows of the Company in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) and other accounting principles generally accepted in India. This responsibility also includes maintenance of adequate accounting records in accordance with the provisions of the Act for safeguarding the assets of the Company and for preventing and detecting frauds and other irregularities; selection and application of appropriate accounting policies; making judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and design, implementation and maintenance of adequate internal financial controls that were operating effectively for ensuring the accuracy and completeness of the accounting records, relevant to the preparation and presentation of the standalone financial statements that give a true and fair view and are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error. In preparing the standalone financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Company or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.

Johnsonberg, PW 15695",Ballard-Robertson,739-01-0242,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Ballard-Robertson for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Ballard-Robertson was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at 5870 Katie Rapids Apt. 308
Johnsonberg, PW 15695 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 739-01-0242 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Ballard-Robertson’s manufacturing unit at 5870 Katie Rapids Apt. 308
Johnsonberg, PW 15695 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://cooley.biz/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 739-01-0242 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 739-01-0242, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Mary Bowman was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 5870 Katie Rapids Apt. 308
Johnsonberg, PW 15695 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Ballard-Robertson should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Mary Bowman at jeff13@example.org or +91 5280514423. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 5870 Katie Rapids Apt. 308

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates. These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance.
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use. In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management. We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes.
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Coleman LLC, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 75674 Mary Via Suite 750
Elizabethtown, NH 40947. In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit of the standalone financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the standalone financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We have determined the matters described below to be the key audit matters to be communicated in our report.","[(2340, 2388, 'address'), (18, 29, 'company'), (1770, 1781, 'company')]"

FPO AA 61681",Allen Inc,176-92-0528,"We have conducted a thorough review of the tax compliance practices followed by Allen Inc for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2023. Our examination included a detailed analysis of corporate tax returns, GST filings, and withholding tax submissions across all divisions. The review focused on ensuring compliance with the latest amendments in tax laws and regulations.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Allen Inc was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team. The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act. The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%.

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II. The assets located at USCGC Anderson
FPO AA 61681 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method. The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office.

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax. The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities.

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D. However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 176-92-0528 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Allen Inc’s manufacturing unit at USCGC Anderson
FPO AA 61681 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL https://clark.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 176-92-0528 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 176-92-0528, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Cassie Hernandez was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at USCGC Anderson
FPO AA 61681 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Allen Inc should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Cassie Hernandez at lgonzalez@example.org or +73 9721246478. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at USCGC Anderson

This review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Allen Inc remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.

Report on the audit of the Standalone Financial Statements
Key Audit Matters Auditors’ response to Key Audit Matters
Property, Plant & Equipment and Intangible Assets
There are areas where management judgement impacts the carrying value of property, plant and equipment, intangible assets and their respective depreciation/amortisation rates These include the decision to capitalize or expense costs; the annual asset life review; the timeliness of the capitalization of assets and the use of management assumptions and estimates for the determination or the measurement and recognition criteria for assets retired from active use Due to the materiality in the context of the Balance Sheet of the Company and the level of judgement and estimates required, we consider this to be an area of significance
We assessed the controls in place over the fixed asset cycle, evaluated the appropriateness of the capitalization process, performed tests of details on costs capitalized, the timeliness of the capitalization of the assets and the de-recognition criteria for assets retired from active use In performing these procedures, we reviewed the judgements made by management including the nature of underlying costs capitalized; determination of realizable value of the assets retired from active use; the appropriateness of asset lives applied in the calculation of depreciation/amortization; the useful lives of assets prescribed in Schedule II to the Act and the useful lives of certain assets as per the technical assessment of the management We observed that the management has regularly reviewed the aforesaid judgements and there are no material changes
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying standalone financial statements of Williams Inc, which comprise the Balance Sheet as at March 31, 2023, the Statement of Profit and Loss (including Other Comprehensive Income), the Statement of Changes in Equity and the Statement of Cash Flows for the year then ended and notes to the standalone financial statements including a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information in which are incorporated the financial statements for the year ended on that date audited by the Branch Auditors of the Company’s one Branch, namely Research & Development (R&D) division situated at 952 Hernandez Common
Guzmanburgh, VT 76991 In our opinion and to the best of our information and according to the explanations given to us, the aforesaid standalone financial statements give the information required by the Companies Act, 2013 (the “Act”) in the manner so required and give a true and fair view in conformity with Indian Accounting Standards specified under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules 2015, as amended and other accounting principles generally accepted in India, of the state of affairs of the Company as at March 31, 2023, and total comprehensive income (comprising of profit and other comprehensive income), changes in equity and its cash flows for the year ended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit of the standalone financial statements in accordance with the Standards on Auditing (SAs) specified under section 143(10) of the Act. Our responsibilities under those Standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the standalone financial statements section of our report. We are independent of the Company in accordance with the Code of Ethics issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (“ICAI”), together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the standalone financial statements under the provisions of the Act and ""the Rules"" thereunder, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ICAI’s Code of Ethics. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion on the standalone financial statements.

This document outlines the methodologies adopted, key findings, and recommendations for strengthening internal processes and ensuring regulatory compliance. The objective of this review was to assess the effectiveness of the existing controls and identify potential areas for enhancement.
The review process included both quantitative and qualitative assessments, leveraging advanced data analytics tools and direct observation techniques. The methodology encompassed:
Risk Assessment:
Identification and prioritization of risk areas within the financial and operational domains
Deployment of risk management frameworks to evaluate the potential impact and likelihood of identified risks
Control Testing:
Execution of control tests to verify the functionality and effectiveness of control measures
Analysis of control gaps and deficiencies in critical areas
Stakeholder Interviews:
Conducting interviews with key personnel to gather insights on control environments and operational challenges
Evaluation of the awareness and understanding of control policies among staff
Several critical findings emerged from the review, indicating areas that require immediate attention and corrective actions:
Financial Control Deficiencies:
Inconsistent application of accounting policies leading to discrepancies in financial reporting
Lack of adequate documentation for significant financial transactions
Operational Control Gaps:
Inefficiencies in the procurement process resulting in unauthorized purchases
Insufficient monitoring of inventory levels causing stock variances
Compliance Shortcomings:
Non-compliance with internal audit recommendations from previous assessments
Delays in regulatory filings and updates
To address the identified deficiencies and enhance the control environment, the following actions are recommended:
Financial Controls:
Standardization of accounting procedures across all departments
Complementation of a centralized documentation system for financial transactions
Operational Controls:
Revision of the procurement policy to include stricter approval processes
Regular inventory audits to ensure accuracy and accountability
Compliance Enhancements:
Establishment of a compliance oversight committee to monitor adherence to audit recommendations
Timely updating and submission of regulatory documents
The review highlights the necessity for continuous improvement in internal controls to mitigate risks and ensure compliance. The implementation of the recommended actions will significantly enhance the operational efficiency and financial integrity of White and Sons
Attached to this document are detailed reports and evidence supporting the findings and recommendations. The Internal Compliance Unit is available for further discussions and clarifications

The audit was conducted in accordance with the Standards on Auditing specified under section 143(10) of the Companies Act, 2013. Our audit involved performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the standalone financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor's judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the company's preparation and fair presentation of the standalone financial statements in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances. Our audit also included evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the standalone financial statements. We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our audit opinion. Our opinion, based on our audit, is that the accompanying standalone financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the company as of March 31, 2023, and of its financial performance and its cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with the Indian Accounting Standards prescribed under section 133 of the Act read with the Companies (Indian Accounting Standards) Rules, 2015, as amended.

Corporate Tax Overview
The corporate tax computation for Wade-Bell was cross-verified against the financial statements audited by our internal team The tax liability was calculated considering various deductions under section 80C, 80D, and other relevant sections of the Income Tax Act The total taxable income stood at INR 500 Crores, with an effective tax rate of 25%

Key points include:

Depreciation Deductions: Claimed as per the Income Tax Act, aligned with the rates prescribed under Schedule II The assets located at 045 Kaufman Crescent
South Alyssaland, HI 09007 were correctly depreciated using the Written Down Value (WDV) method The details of high-value assets have been corroborated with the asset register maintained at the corporate office

Tax Credits: The company has utilized carry-forward losses from previous financial years to offset the current tax liability, reducing the net payable tax The adjusted tax liability has been duly filed with the tax authorities

Deductions: The deductions for contributions to the Employee Provident Fund (EPF) and Gratuity are in compliance with sections 80C and 80D However, we noted a delay in the deposit of EPF contributions for some employees whose SSNs 029-23-4108 end with ‘4567’. This delay has been flagged, and a provision for potential interest and penalties has been recommended.

GST Compliance
The Goods and Services Tax (GST) compliance was reviewed in detail:

GST Payments: All GST payments were made on time except for minor discrepancies in the month of July. The shortfall of INR 2 Lakhs in GST payments for Wade-Bell’s manufacturing unit at 045 Kaufman Crescent
South Alyssaland, HI 09007 was rectified in subsequent months, with interest computed at 18% p.a.

Input Tax Credit (ITC): ITC claims were verified against the purchase invoices. The ITC related to capital goods purchased by the Research & Development (R&D) division were adequately accounted for. However, it was observed that certain invoices, particularly from vendors identified by the URL http://humphrey.com/, were not uploaded on the GST portal within the stipulated time, leading to an ITC reversal.

Reconciliation: A reconciliation of GSTR-3B with GSTR-2A was performed, revealing minor mismatches which have been communicated to the concerned department. The finance team has been instructed to follow up with vendors whose SSNs 029-23-4108 match records ending in '7890' to ensure timely filing.

Withholding Tax (TDS)
Withholding tax (TDS) was analyzed across various payments made during the year:

Salaries: TDS on salaries was deducted as per Section 192 of the Income Tax Act. Employee details, including SSNs 029-23-4108, were cross-checked with the HR records. A mismatch was found in the TDS calculations for employees whose SSNs end in ‘1234’ due to incorrect consideration of their investment declarations.

Professional Fees: TDS under Section 194J was reviewed, with a specific focus on payments exceeding INR 30,000. One such transaction involving a payment to Mariah Williams was identified where TDS was not deducted. The legal team has been notified, and a rectification process has been initiated.

Rent Payments: TDS on rent payments was calculated correctly, but it was observed that rent agreements for premises at 045 Kaufman Crescent
South Alyssaland, HI 09007 lacked proper documentation. The agreements are currently being reviewed to ensure compliance.

Audit Recommendations
Based on our review, we recommend the following actions to mitigate tax risks:

Timely Payment of Taxes: Ensure that all taxes, including GST and TDS, are paid within the due dates to avoid interest and penalties. The finance team should regularly review the payment schedules, particularly for transactions involving large sums.

Documentation: Improve the documentation process, especially for transactions involving high-value assets and payments. Ensure that all contracts and agreements are updated and compliant with tax regulations.

Employee Training: Conduct training sessions for the finance and HR teams on the latest tax amendments and compliance requirements. Emphasize the importance of accurate TDS calculations and timely tax payments.

Automation of Processes: Consider implementing tax compliance software to automate GST reconciliation, TDS computation, and other tax-related processes. This will reduce manual errors and ensure adherence to compliance timelines.

Conclusion
We have attached a detailed report with the findings and recommendations. The finance team at Wade-Bell should review this report and initiate the necessary actions. For any queries or further clarifications, please contact Mariah Williams at jennifer37@example.org or +840 0190795886. All physical correspondence can be directed to our office at 045 Kaufman Crescent
South Alyssaland, HI 09007.

This review reflects our commitment to ensuring that Wade-Bell remains compliant with all tax regulations. We appreciate your cooperation during the audit process and look forward to your prompt action on the recommendations.
